/*
Package telegraph has functions and types used for interacting with the Telegraph API.

Telegra.ph is a minimalist publishing tool that allows you to create richly formatted posts and push them to the Web
in just a click. Telegraph posts also get beautiful Instant View pages on Telegram.

To maintain the purity of the basic interface, we launched the @Telegraph bot for those who require advanced features.
This bot can help you manage your articles across any number of devices and get page view statistics for any Telegraph
page.

Anyone can enjoy the simplicity of Telegraph publishing, not just Telegram users. For this reason, all developers are
welcome to use this Telegraph API to create bots like @Telegraph for any other platform, or even standalone interfaces.
